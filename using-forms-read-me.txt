- using forms I can capture information from the individual completing the form using the following input types.
I feel like most of these are pretty self-explanatory in what information each can be used for. 

<input type="button">
<input type="checkbox">
<input type="color">
<input type="date">
<input type="datetime-local">
<input type="email">
<input type="file">
<input type="hidden">
<input type="image">
<input type="month">
<input type="number">
<input type="password">
<input type="radio">
<input type="range">
<input type="reset">
<input type="search">
<input type="submit">
<input type="tel">
<input type="text">
<input type="time">
<input type="url">
<input type="week">

- tags that help with input type would be label tags.
 This allows the developer the ability to add text that correlates and appends to the form input fields. This text allows the form of participant 
that ability to know what information each field is looking to capture. 

- some tags are more beneficial to tan others when it comes to character validation. For example
if you were looking to capture an email address you will want to use the <input type="email"> rather than text. It will look for email address formating to help make sure the correct information is being submitted. 
Another example would be the <input type="datetime-local"> to make sure you are capturing a valid date and time. This prevents the user from sending over data in a way that is hard to interpret reducing future conflicts. 
 
-to use the data programmatically, one would need to have a repository or data collection point set up to store the user data. 
This may be done with the use of a local database file of even a collection of .txt files that can be cataloged.
